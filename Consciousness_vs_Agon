We are going to take as an axiom that consciousness is a good thing that is worthy of expansion.

# What is consciousness
Introspection, experience, awareness of external and internal existence. Unconcious cognition (Julian Jaynes). Fast and slow/automatic and intentive (Daniel Kahneman). Glasgow Coma Scale. P-conciousness vs A-consciousness (Ned Block). William Lycan's 8 kinds of consciousness. Verbal report. Class consciousness (Karl Marx)

# Consciousness in groups and individuals

There are many ways to define consciousness, but here we will consider it in terms of inputs and outputs. In a conscious group we should expect it to have a mechinism for taking in information, processing it, and carrrying out some act based on this information. It is clear that almost any interacting group of people will do this to some degree, but what is the clearest example?

# Agon and its effects on consciousness

When there is struggle and politics, conscious actors within the system seek one outcome for the consciousness of the system. In doing so, they may actively disrupt the taking in of information, the processing of that information, and the final act.
